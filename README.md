# pathtraversal
Simple Python3 script to execute a path traversal attack on a targetted url (provided by the user) using TOR (LINUX).

You can find all the libraries needed into the requirement.txt. I reccomend to install everything on a venv.

Restart tor before launching (on Linux: sudo service tor restart).

Didactic purpose only.
